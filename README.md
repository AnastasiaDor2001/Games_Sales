# Sales of video games on different platforms in years 1980-2020
The goal of this project is to visualize video game sales in different regions from 1980 to 2020.
The data set is taken from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

Here we can see data such as the year, the name of the video game and its producer, the platform on which the game was released, as well as the number of sales in millions of dollars in the regions of North America, Europe, Japan, other regions and total global sales.
# Data exploration
First of all, missing data was verified and basic statistics were explored. Since the number of NA was very low comparing to the whole dataset, these values were dropped.

As stated earlier, the dataset contains data from 1980 up to 2020. We can also see large fluctuations in the amounts of sales. This is noticeable at the stage of checking the minimum and maximum values of the data. For example, the maximum of global sales was 82.74 million USD and the minimum was 0.01 million USD. The average value is 0.54 million dollars, while the median is at 0.17 million dollars. The fluctuations in the data are clearly visible in the graph. Sales peaked in 2008, after which they declined. This mainly affected the American and European markets, but the Japanese and other markets also experienced an increase in sales at this time.

Next, it was examined which genre was the most popular in each of the years presented. There was no definite trend from 1980 to 1989. Platformers, shooters and action games changed places, but after that platformers took the lead and held it for 6 years. After some time action games moved to the top and remained the most popular genre from 2001 to 2016.
It was also interesting to see which platform led the way in sales. Nintendo DS was at its peak in 2008, with Wii in second place. A few years before that, Playstation 2 was popular.
In 2008, more than 50% of sales belonged to the U.S. market, about 25% to the European market, with Japan and other countries sharing the rest.
The top selling games in the U.S. market in 2009 were Wii Sports Resort, New Super Mario Bros Wii, Wii Fit Plus, Just Dance, EA Sports Active.
